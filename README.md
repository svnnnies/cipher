# CS 32301 Homework 4 (Caesaer shift)

encrypt.py is a python file that encrypts your full name using a random caesar shift.

No extra extensions or libraries are needed to run the encrypt.py file. Just make sure to have python installed.

# How to run:
1- Open a terminal in this folder.

2- In the terminal write down: $python encrypt.py

3- When prompted, enter your full name (this is what will be encrypted)

4- The program will print a cipher text and will ask to guess the integer key which will allow you to input an integer between (1-25).

5- Keep guessing until you find the key. Once guessed right, the program will decrypt and show plaintext when correct.
